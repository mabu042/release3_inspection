# release3_inspection
## Purpose of inspection
We want to get a rough idea about the actual content of the cleaned verion of the 3rd data release. More specifically, for each language L we want to estimate the proportion of documents that are:
1) not in the language L,
2) contain undesireble artifacts, 
3) fully undesirable because they are mostly unnatural,
4) undesirable porn texts.

## Data for round 1 of HPLT 3.0 (cleaned) inspection: 
* samples stratified by language,
*  5 batches of random documents per language,
*  200 documents per batch,
*  500/500 characters from the beginning of the fist/second half of each text.

## Inspection
Please select one or more batches for a language you want to inspect. "Reserve" the batch(es) by filling in your name in the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-p0pFSm2uPCxNfvXXizNuHfhzo_NAN9LX945M-Q-hQA/edit?usp=sharing).
Fill in the labels and push the updated files back to this repository.

We ask to provide 4 binary labels for each example:
* porn? empty/1: if the text looks like porn put 1, otherwise leave empty
* text artifacts? empty/1: if the text contains some artifacts that should not appear in a running text and should not be generated by LLMs (e.g. traces of menus or markup not removed by text extraction, headers and list items without proper delimitation, truncated text and snippet markers) put 1, otherwise leave empty
* unnatural? empty/1: if most of the text looks unnatural (e.g. word lists for SEO, mostly boilerplate) put 1, otherwise leave empty
* lang correct? 0/1: always fill this field (otherwise we will not distinguish labeled and unlabeled examples), put 0 if most of the text is not in the target language, otherwise put 1.

## Advice on inspection
One way to annotate is using LibreOffice Calc. For convenience: 
* make the text preview area larger;
* optimize column width (select the first 5 columns, select Format -> Columns -> Optimal Width...);
* optimize row height (select the whole table with e.g. ctrl+a / cmd+a, select Format -> Rows -> Height.., enter a reasonable value e.g. 0.15);
* freeze the header row (View -> Freeze Cells -> Freeze First Row) and the first 5 columns (select them and click View -> Freeze Rows and Columns);
This can look like this:
