# Nikolay, [rus_Cyrl/batch0.tsv](../annot_round1/rus_Cyrl/batch0.tsv)

(Outdated, used as an example)
Almost all examples are in the correct language, 1 example is the first part in Russian and the second in Ukrainian. 

Lots of commercial ads, some contain more running texts (e.g. descriptions of hotels), some less (e.g. sound equipment).

Occasionally the first part contains traces of menus, while the second part consists of running text.
