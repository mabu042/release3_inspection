# Nikolay, [rus_Cyrl/batch0.tsv](../annot_round1/rus_Cyrl/batch0.tsv)

(Outdated, used as an example)
Almost all examples are in the correct language, 1 example is the first part in Russian and the second in Ukrainian. 

Lots of commercial ads, some contain more running texts (e.g. descriptions of hotels), some less (e.g. sound equipment).

Occasionally the first part contains traces of menus, while the second part consists of running text.

# Marta, [spa_Latn/batch0.tsv](../annot_round1/spa_Latn/batch0.tsv)

* Lang id is perfect (only one document being half Portuguese, one with a sentence in English, one with a sentence in French and one with a sentence in Italian)
* Only one porn document.
* Some boilerplate in the documents (links, copyright texts, social media links, menus...). I only marked those as artifacts when they spread across the document, making the reading annoying.
* Some truncated texts (i.e. "Read more" tags) 
* Some oversplitted sentences (i.e. doc 158 or 199)
* Some documents contain sentences repeated twice (maybe images alt text)
* Other issues not covered by the current evaluation labels  (doc number starting in 2, since 1 is the header of the tsv):
  * Glued words in docs 9, 44, 48, 70, 79 and 130
  * Clearly MT or AI generated text in docs 15, 22, 38, 42, 45, 47, 64, 65, 97, 116, 164 and 170

# Patrick, [cmn_Hans/batch0.tsv](../annot_round1/cmn_Hans/batch0.tsv)

* Lang id is perfect, only one document has slightly more English than Chinese, so labelled as 0 under "correct language"
* 2-3 porn
* Some documents are apparently news titles concatenated together, so natural/fluent at the sentence level but not "coherent".
* Some documents have a long list of items, but without text artifacts

# Ona, [cat_Latn/batch0.tsv](../annot_round1/cat_Latn/batch0.tsv)
* Lang id is perfect, atlhough a few documents may contain a single sentence in Spanish or English.
* 0 porn documents.
* Some boilerplate in the documents (links, copyright texts, social media links, menus...). I did not mark this as text artifacts, as the majority of the text is good and readable.
* Some truncated texts
* Some oversplitted sentences (i.e. doc 55 or 160)
* Other issues not covered by the current evaluation labels:
  * Glued words
  * Clearly MT or AI generated text in docs 2 ("Bons Aires" instead of "Buenos Aires"), 4 ("Friends" as "Amics", the tv show, was never actually translated to Catalan), 86 ("after test" translated as "postgust"), 95
  * Bad encoding of accent characters (doc 137): "Per grans Órees geogrÓfiques van augmentar la Uniˇ Europea (3,1%), altres pa´sos i territoris d'Europa (10,9%), i AmŔrica del Nord (1,1%). "

# Peter [jpn_Jpan/batch0.tsv](../annot_round1/jpn_Jpan/batch0.tsv)

* All Lang ID is correct
* Many of the pages have quite a few text artifacts such as full menus in between proper Japanese sentences.
* There are lots of pages with e-commerce listings for consumer products, hotels, real estate etc.
* There are also lots of pages with personal blogs. These seem very useful as they are written as long-form conversational streams of consciousness. I think this data (compared to something like news) would help make an effective chatbot.
* Other smaller items were lists of Tweets, IT how-to guides, horse racing tips, horoscopes etc.
* Some texts are truncated by ellipses, and therefore unnatural (is this intentional?).
* 1 porn item. You probably want to add オナニー (masturbation) to your porn word list as there is no context where that word does not refer to masturbation.
* There is one item where a man says that he wants to die because his girlfriend broke up with him (line 155). Is this something we want to remove?
